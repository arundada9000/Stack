# Stack Visualization 🔢🧑‍💻

Welcome to **Stack Visualization**! This project allows you to visualize the operations of a stack data structure in a dynamic and interactive way. You can see how elements are pushed onto and popped from the stack, helping you better understand stack behavior and operations.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Stack Operations:**
  - **Push:** Add elements to the stack and watch them appear visually.
  - **Pop:** Remove elements from the stack and see the effect in real time.
  - **Peek:** View the top element of the stack without removing it.
- **Step-by-Step Visualization:** Watch the stack change as each operation is performed, with clear and easy-to-understand animations.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** See how the stack grows and shrinks with each operation.
- **Stack Overflow & Underflow Handling:** Handle stack overflow and underflow situations gracefully.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Stack Visualization** is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - Vanilla JS for stack operations and animations
- **Libraries:**
  - No external libraries were used; the project is built with **vanilla JavaScript** for educational purposes.

## 🌟 How It Works

1. **Visualizing Stack Operations:**
   - The stack is represented visually on the page with a stack container, where each element is shown as a box.
   - Push and Pop operations are animated to help you see the effects in real time.
2. **Real-Time Updates:**

   - As you push or pop elements, the stack automatically updates and shows the current state of the stack.

3. **Stack Overflow/Underflow:**
   - If you try to push an element onto a full stack or pop an element from an empty stack, an error message is shown to handle these edge cases.

## 🛡️ Privacy Notice

**Stack Visualization** does not collect any user data or require any backend. The project runs entirely in the browser and all operations are processed locally. No personal information is stored or transmitted.
